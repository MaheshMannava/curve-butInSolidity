# curve-butInSolidity
The primary goals of this repository are:</br>

1. Provide a Solidity implementation of the Curve Finance StableSwap3Pool contract as an alternative to the original Vyper implementation.</br>
2. Optimize the Solidity implementation using inline assembly to achieve gas efficiency and reduce transaction costs.</br>
3. Write comprehensive unit tests to ensure the correctness and functionality of the Solidity contract.</br>
